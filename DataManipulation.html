            Data for the Project <br>

       <h4> 
       	The Application and whole research and analysis of the project wouldnt have happened without the data. 
       	<br>
       	Below are the data extraction and manipulation steps which I followed during the course of the project.
       </h4>
       <ul type = "I">
       	<li> Focal Point of the data was the immense work done by <a href ="http://robparal.blogspot.com/2012/05/hard-to-find-census-data-on-chicago.html">Chicago Data Guy</a> </li>

        <br>The complete set of data on every parameter was present broken down to the 77 communities in Chicago and we had multiple excel files for each parameter. We had to compare Chicago to its different communities and compare them across multiple parameters. 
        <br>

       	<li> My area of focus was Race of Origin and Age & Gender.</li>

        <br>
        The first step was to segregate data to be used for different parameters and also according to the community. For higher complexity, we also had to visualize data based on the different districts of Chicago. I achieved this by adding each community to its respective district and collating the data for each district and having separate files for districts and communities. This gave me another level of control to understand data. 

       	<li>Visualization of Data</li> 

        <br> 
        The next step of the process was to find intuitive ways to display data to the user so that it is immediately understandable and the user can dive into it to understand the whole thought process behind it. I narrowed down to major types of visualizations - Bar Charts and Pie Charts. Within Bar Charts, I used grouped bar charts and simple bar charts to get data. Race data has been visualized using Bar Charts and Age & Gender Data has been visualized using Pie Charts. The main reason of using bar charts to is give an easy way for people to understand what to see and get the numbers of each bar and then relate and compare against each other. 
        <br> 
        Pie Charts are a different breed of visualizations which help people visualize data against each quantities but maybe just compare it in a smaller axis and something that a lay person can relate to. Pie Charts also help a person understand in quantitative terms as data is displayed in a circle. This is also why I chose to show Pie Charts and not show donut charts. Pie Charts give you a way to get the quantities in more than just raw numbers as you can compare according to the angle of the data given. 
        <br>
        
        <li> 
        Placement of the Data on screen.
        </li>
        <br> 
        We had to show a lot of data on screen at the same time. I choose to put my map on the left side of the screen so that a person understands what he/she would be exploring on that day and also like one says- a picture is worth a thousand words and it immediately connects with the user. I broke down my screen into three parts to help me display different according to the communities or districts and compare them to each other.
       </ul>
       <br>
       Chicago has been categorized as a melting pot for multiple communities and culture and after development and creation of my application, I can attest to this fact. Exploring Chicago by traversing it through the different types of data has been eye opening and enlightening and I feel I understand and connect with Chicago on a whole new level.
