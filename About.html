      <h3> 
          Project one under Visualization and Visual Analytics class we had to create a map of chicago and describe the demographics of the CHICAGO using the D3JS library with Javascript as the main language of use. The project deals with trying to uncover the basic trends and patterns that emerge through the demographics of Chicago based on different parameters.
          <br>  
          The project deals with the following parameters for identifying demographics : <br>
          <ul type = "I">
            <li> Age and Gender in Chicago</li>
            <li> Race by Population</li>
            <li> Race and Age</li>
          </ul>

          The D3 library was created by Mike Bostock and we are using the extension of that. Mike's git has been immensely helpful to learn and understand the concepts of D3JS and which has helped me get my application up and running. Alongside, the following websites have been helpful. <br>
