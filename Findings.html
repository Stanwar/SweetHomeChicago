       <h4> 
       	One of the major objectives of creating this application was to enable the user to find and unearth various hidden patterns across the city of Chicago.
       	<br>
       	Below are some of my findings.
       </h4>
       <ul type = "I">
       	<li>There is a sizable number of people of Mexican Descent. In some communities they are even greater than African American Community</li>
       	<li>Asian Population is majorly concentrated across some of the community areas such as Armour Square.</li>
       	<li>There are a lot more people from South American Countries as compared to European Countries</li> 
       </ul>
       <br>
       Chicago has been categorized as a melting pot for multiple communities and culture and after development and creation of my application, I can attest to this fact. Exploring Chicago by traversing it through the different types of data has been eye opening and enlightening.
